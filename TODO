1. Create a micro container in tier3 that does the following:
  a. Log into the briefcam server.
  b. Deletes cases that are older than 2 days by performing a series of clicks on the websiste.
2. Try using rabbit message queue instead of confluent kakfka.
3. Move the "tier2 - orchestration service for opening rtsp media streams" into docker service / docker swarm. 
   a. Bring in the messaging queue between the fauxon/couch db and the tier1 producer which reads the camera document from the 
   database and enqueues them to the rabbit message queue.
   b. A swarm of docker service microservice containers dequeue the message from the queue and connects to the RTSP camera 
   mentioned in the document.
4. Run pylint on the code and fix all the warnings.
5. Make sure that all the unit test cases run successfully when the Jenkins check in trigger hook gets invoked.
